Sometimes when working on Xcode Playground you may experience some unexpected behavior where Playground gets stuck on 'Running...' without any obvious reason. ðŸ¤·:triumph: 

The root cause of this issue is Xcode trying to run the code on a simulator.
By default, when creating a Playground, Xcode will set the platform to iOS and it will open a simulator to run the code. 

So, if you are not working on iOS-specific code, you can solve this by switching the platform on the Playground Settings to `macOS`.

You can change that on the File Inspector tab, which you can either access from the Inspector area or by using the shortcut Command (`âŒ˜`) + Option (`âŒ¥`) + 1.

With that change in place, your Playground will compile and run successfully :rocket:
